# 📊 Power BI Interactive Dashboards

Welcome to my Power BI Dashboard repository!  
Here you'll find interactive dashboards designed to turn raw data into meaningful insights. These dashboards showcase my learnings in data analysis, transformation, and visualization.

## 🚀 About the Project

This repository contains various interactive dashboards created using Power BI. I built these dashboards to explore different datasets and gain practical experience in designing clear, insightful, and dynamic data visualizations.

These dashboards demonstrate:
- **Clean data transformation**
- **Well-structured and interactive visuals**
- **Effective data storytelling**
- **Practical business insights**

## 🎓 Learning Journey

I have been working on dashboards for some time, and recently I enhanced my skills through **Skill Courses by Satish Dhawale sir**. His guidance helped me better understand:
- Advanced data transformation techniques
- User-friendly report building
- Publishing and sharing reports on the Power BI Service
